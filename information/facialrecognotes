FACIAL LANDMARKS for detection of exrpessions:

The first step in this process will be detecting a face and extracting facial landmarks using dlib and opencv with python.

Now Facial Landmarks is a portioon of " Shape-Predictor".
Given an imput image , the predictor attempts to localize key points of interest along the shape.

THAT here is : facial structures
#step1 : localize the face in the full image
#step2 : detect the key features

There are a variety of facial landmark detectors, but all methods essentially try to localize and label the following facial regions:

Mouth
Right eyebrow
Left eyebrow
Right eye
Left eye
Nose
Jaw

The one in the dlib  library works like this .. This method starts by using:

1.A training set of labeled facial landmarks on an image. These images are manually labeled, specifying specific (x, y)-coordinates of regions surrounding each facial structure.

2.Priors, of more specifically, the probability on distance between pairs of input pixels.

The pre-trained facial landmark detector inside the dlib library is used to estimate the location of 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.
