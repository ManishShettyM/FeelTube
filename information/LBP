LBP :

Local binary Patterns

So given an image it finds 3x3 pixel sqaures and converts it into a certain value called the lbp val

eg :

 5 8 1
 5 4 1
 3 7 2 

 is converted first by choosing the central value and filling the other pixels with 

 1 -> if center is >=
 0 -> if center is <

 ie:

 0 0 1
 0 0 1
 1 0 1

 in 2d array format read anticlockwise from top middle :

 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 => bin() => 23

 like this an lbp array is made

 3x3 has 9 pixels - 1 center pixel
 = 8 pixels
 = 2^8 possible patterns = 256

min =0 max =256

So a histogram is constructed over that range
