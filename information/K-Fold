K-Folds dataset splitting

Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).

Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining folds form the training set.

That is every fold gets to be a test as well as training set on the whole.

SKLEARN andd Python:


KFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=False, random_state=None)

n_splits = no of folds
shuffle = where to shuffle the dataset

methods:

.split(X) -> generates indices to split the dataset into training and test
